## Introduction

The application being structured around the Symfony Framework Version 6.3 it is basically an M.V.C. architecture.
Some parts are built following the Micro-Services architectures to make it easier to manage and maintain. 

At this date, I'm an experienced developer with approximately seven months of development, do pardon me if you find some silly things in my code.
I'll comment the code as I wrote this documentation.  

To sum up the tools and languages used  : 
— PHP 8.2 
— Twig with HTML5
— Some JavaScript script
- MariaDB SQL Database

I will begin by presenting the basics of the app structure, then I will explain them in more details.
